### Questions

1.  Who appears to be the sender?
  As displayed the sender appears to be the security team and the email address is <support@secure-verification-update.com>
2.  Does the email create urgency or pressure?
   Yes. It uses an artificial countdown and threatening language to panic the user into acting quickly without thinking.
3.  Are there spelling or grammar mistakes?
   Yes.  "Failure" is misspelled as "failiure" in the last paragaraph.
4.  Does the link match the organisation domain?
   No. The domain looks intentionally generic  and confusing. It dies not belong to a known, legitimate organization(like microsoft,google, or a specific bank), which is typical of a phising infrastructure designed to mimic security alerts.

### Reflection

Explain why attackers use phishing emails.
Attackers use phising emails because they target the weakest link in cybersecurity: human posychology. It is often much easier to trick a person into giving away their credentials or clicking a malicious link using urgency and fear than it is to hack through a secure firewall. It allows attackers to easily 
steal credentials, deploy malware, or gain unauthorized access to networks at a very low cost.-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 2 --- Link Inspection

Hover over the link in the email (or copy link) and inspect the URL.
